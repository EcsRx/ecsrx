# HELLO

Welcome etc!

> If you are viewing this in github you can view the book version of it [HERE](https://ecsrx.gitbook.io/project/)

This is an attempt to document most of the important stuff around how to use the library, it is recommended that you follow the order of the TOC, however if you are not using the gitbook version then just look at the summary.md file and follow that order.

The flow is generally:

- Stuff you should ideally know before using the framework
- About the framework and how to use it
- The bits which make up the framework and how to use them
- Making larger applications with the framework
- How the underlying architecture fits together
- How you can extend the framework and use plugins
- How to use the framework in a more performance oriented manner
- Other guff
